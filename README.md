# Not ready yet

I'd like to eventually make a tiling window manager for Gnome Shell, or maybe a super-extensive
layout mode for [Node Window Manager][NWM], because honestly I'm not sure if I want to get involved with GJS.

# How to run

This project uses [Middleman][MM] + [LiveReload][LR] for fun and rapid Javascript prototyping.
Here's how you get started:

    $ cd ~/src/tiling-layout
    $ bundle install
    $ middleman server
    
[NWM]: http://mixu.net/nwm/
[MM]: http://middlemanapp.com
[LR]: http://middlemanapp.com/extensions/livereload/
